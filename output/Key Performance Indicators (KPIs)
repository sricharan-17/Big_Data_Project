📈 KPI 1 - Next Peak Demand Day: The model predicts the highest demand will be on 2025-10-20 with a value of 48.33 Crore.
📅 KPI 2 - Average Weekly Fluctuation: On average, cash withdrawals on Mondays are 13.87% higher than on Sundays, representing the most significant weekly pattern.
🎉 KPI 3 - Holiday Impact: The model has quantified the specific financial impact of dozens of regional holidays, separating their effect from regular weekly trends (as shown in the components plot).


--- 🚀 Actionable Business Recommendation ---
Based on the clear and predictable weekly peak identified by our model, we recommend a strategic shift in cash logistics. The primary ATM refill schedule for high-traffic urban centers should be moved to Monday mornings. This will directly address the highest demand period, preventing ATM downtime, improving customer satisfaction, and optimizing operational efficiency.
